description: Field notes. My way to expand my knowledge and capture what I learn.

It’s interesting how since we leave school, we don’t really capture what we learn. We learn on the job, but what do we really learn? How do we know, and how do we measure?

At one point, after nearly three years in a new and challenging job with the steepest learning curve of my life, I had the opportunity to take a break and reflect on what I’d experienced. I felt that I had learned a lot, but it was elusive. Explaining what I had learned felt like sand between my fingers. I felt I knew, but as I explained, I clearly didn’t fully know. Maybe it was an example of the Dunning-Kruger effect in play. 

I decided to try and capture my learnings and do so moving forward as I learn new things. The benefit is that I build a record of what I know. As an added benefit, I’ve discovered how writing clarifies my thoughts and helps me uncover gaps in my knowledge and thereby actively helping me escape the Dunning-Kruger effect.

I’ve chosen to capture my learnings in the format of ‘field notes’. I know that what I write is not, and will not, be the objective truth. It is simply my observation of the world and what I reason from it. 

The process of writing these notes has helped me; maybe they can help you too.
