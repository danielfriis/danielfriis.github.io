Always strived for more; for better grades, better physique, nicer things, bigger job, more wealth. To reach for it, I’ve set goals. Because that’s what you are supposed to do, right? I’ve often managed to achieve those goals, but I’ve repeatedly been miserable in the process — especially when I didn’t reach the goals I set.</p>

<p>For a long time, I was convinced that this was the way to live your life. Set goals and suffer the hard work towards them. However, I’ve realised that this is a flawed way of living. The problem for me was that I focused so much on the goals that I wasn’t really happy until I reached them. In doing so, I put most of my happiness into some future reward and made my present life more or less miserable.</p>

<p>Beyond living in the future and putting off happiness, it’s also an ineffective way to even reach those goals. The thing is, goals in and of themselves don’t mean a thing. They are just hopes and dreams. It’s the challenges you accept and the practices that you adopt that will get you there.</p>

<p>I recently stumbled upon a quote by the greek stoic philosopher, Epictetus, who once said, “The more we value things outside our control, the less control we have”. That’s precisely the problem with focussing too much on goals. By valuing things that are not real, we lose control and, in turn, jeopardize our happiness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more we value things outside our control, the less control we have.
<cite>Epictetus, Greek Stoic philosopher</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way to regain control and put happiness into the present is by learning to love the challenge more than the potential reward. When you do that, you are successful every time you address the challenge. People focussing on goals are only successful when those goals are reached. Additionally, it will also make you more likely to achieve your goals in the first place.</p>

<p>A classic example is the weight loss diets that are heavily advertised everywhere. The problem is that to remain ‘fit’, as the diet promises, you must completely change your lifestyle — not just do a four-week diet from a magazine. But to be happy in that lifestyle, you have to actually value that new lifestyle and the challenge of getting and remaining fit — not just the goal itself.</p>

<p>Similarly, many successful entrepreneurs, when interviewed, state that “it was never about the money”, and for a long time, I didn’t believe them. But I’ve started to do so because, in most cases, there’s no way they would have endured the years of hard work and long hours if they didn’t love the challenges they were facing.</p>

<p>Those that find joy in working out are successful every time they go to the gym — being fit becomes an inevitable byproduct. The same goes for the ‘successful’ entrepreneur. They love the challenges of starting and running a business — financial reward is the byproduct.</p>

<p>So, what’s the takeaway here? The way I’ve started to think about it is with this example: if my goal was to become wealthy and I was told that I could do so only by practicing law, I would a) never become wealthy, and b) never be happy, because I cannot find joy in law (I’ve tried), so I will never be good, and therefore never reach my goal.</p>

<p>Instead, I need to completely reverse my thinking. The goal is not important — it’s the challenge I choose to put my energy into which is important. Choose a challenge you love and whatever rewards you were aiming for initially, are much more likely to materialize. And if they don’t it doesn’t matter — you are already ‘successful’.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daniel Friis</name><email>d@friis.me</email></author><category term="health" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always been chasing the next goal, but I've recently found that it's a flawed way of living.

I’ve come to accept them and expect them as part of being human. But recently, I’ve realised how I can set myself up for more happy emotions than sad ones. I’ve named this setup my ‘Happiness Filter’ and it consists of five habits which positively influence the way I experience the world.</p>

<p>On any given day, it’s the small things that may throw me into a high or low; a compliment from a stranger, a ray of sunshine, a misplaced piece of clothing, or the rain when I’m biking. How I feel about any of those situations depends immensely on the condition of my ‘Happiness Filter’.</p>

<p><strong><em>Exercise</em></strong></p>

<p>For example, I found that after I’ve exercised, I would generally be in a great mood; confident and optimistic about the future. The list of things to be happy about would be long and the list of things to be sad about would be almost non-existent.</p>

<p><strong><em>Sleep</em></strong></p>

<p>On the other hand, whenever I’m feeling discouraged or sad, I’m usually also sleep deprived and tired. Getting enough sleep has proved to be one of the biggest determinants of how I experience the world and so if any of the habits are in conflict for time, this is the one I prioritise.</p>

<p><strong><em>Socialise</em></strong></p>

<p>As an introvert, I don’t naturally seek to socialise. But even introverts need to socialise. Being around other people gives me a sense of belonging and going too long without seeing close friends can make me feel quite lonely.</p>

<p><strong><em>Time alone</em></strong></p>

<p>On the other hand, spending time alone is an opportunity for me to recharge. I usually do some sort of meditation where I simply sit for 15 min and let thoughts come and go. This declutters my brain and brings a sense of clarity to my mind.</p>

<p><strong><em>Gratitude</em></strong></p>

<p>Finally, filling my mind with happy thoughts, means there’s less room for sad thoughts. So, I try to spend five minutes every night listing three good things that happened to me on that day. It’s a great way to end the day, and I usually take those memories with me to bed as I fall asleep.</p>

<p>Those five habits above are what make up my happiness filter. 9 out of 10 times where I find myself sad or discouraged, it’s because I’ve neglected some of them. Practising the neglected habits will instantly get me back to a good place.</p>

<p>Which habits bring you joy? They are usually easy to relegate and neglect in a busy schedule — but don’t. They are vitally important to your happiness and likely also to your effectiveness.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daniel Friis</name><email>d@friis.me</email></author><category term="health" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few specific habits are vital to my mental health.

Frankly, I’ve been quite confused as words like mission, vision, goals, objectives, and strategy are used interchangeably by most people.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, it seems that <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/11/many-strategies-fail-because-theyre-not-actually-strategies">most strategies fail because they are in fact not strategies</a>. So, those people that talk about strategy often don’t know what strategy is. I hope I’m not joining that choir by writing this note, but instead can be a voice of clarity.</p>

<p>From my experience, goals are most often confused with strategy. A goal disguised as strategy may sound something like: “Our strategy is to become the leading software consultancy in the world”, which is a great aspiration, but nothing but wishful thinking without a proper plan. The problem with such ‘strategies’  is that they don’t guide action and decision-making.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Strategy is not goal-setting — it’s problem-solving.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A good strategy should clearly and specifically define the obstacle of a situation and outline a set of coordinated actions to deal with that obstacle. They should make it clear to everyone involved in carrying out the strategy what to do and what not to do.</p>

<p>My take on strategy follows a simple four-element build-up, based on the Situation-Complication-Resolution (SCR) framework by McKinsey and definitions from the book Good Strategy/Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt.</p>

<h4 id="1-situation">1) Situation</h4>
<p>First, you must describe the circumstances you find yourself in. They might be self-imposed or the result of things outside your control, like changing consumer preferences. The common denominator is that they describe circumstances outside your direct control; an outcome rather than a cause.</p>

<p><em>Example: Customer satisfaction has dropped 15%</em></p>

<h4 id="2-obstacle">2) Obstacle</h4>
<p>Next, you must identify the reason for the situation; i.e. the obstacle which is preventing you from reaching a more favorable state. You can do so by asking ‘why’ and keep doing that until you reach the core reason for the situation. The trick is to not go so far that your obstacle becomes a solution; or not far enough, that your obstacle remains a ‘situation’. As an example, ‘Underperformance’ is not an obstacle; that’s an outcome of your obstacle — i.e. still in the situation realm.</p>

<p>Customer satisfaction has dropped 15% — Why? — Because the quality of our product has decreased — Why? — Because we’ve neglected maintenance on our machines</p>

<p><em>Example: Lack of maintenance on our machines</em></p>

<h4 id="3-approach">3) Approach</h4>
<p>The next step is to start describing the solution to your obstacle. The approach describes as a one-liner, the outcome of whatever actions you’ll be taking to address the obstacle. It should be specific enough to focus and align those subsequent actions.</p>

<p><em>Example: Improve and maintain the condition of our machinery</em></p>

<h4 id="4-actions">4) Actions</h4>
<p>As a final element of your strategy, you must describe the specific actions which leads to the outcome described by your approach. The actions should be coordinated and support each other towards the same outcome.</p>

<p><em>Example: 1) Hire two technicians, 2) Define protocols for maintenance and inspection</em></p>

<h2 id="common-mistakes">Common mistakes</h2>

<p><strong>Complexity</strong>. A strategy using inflated words and complex ideas, does nothing but create the illusion of strategic thinking. In reality, it’s all fluff and no substance. A good strategy is achieved not by adding things, but by removing anything unnecessary and have the essentials stand out.</p>

<p><strong>Failure to face the real obstacle.</strong> It’s important to honestly define the obstacle. If you don’t, chances are that you will be working on the wrong things or not allow for the best solution to emerge.</p>

<p><strong>Mistaking goals for strategy.</strong> Many bad strategies are just statements of desire rather than plans for overcoming obstacles.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis paralysis.</strong> The world is infinitely complex so describing any part of your strategy with 100% accuracy and certainty is both impossible and counterproductive. You should aim to just get close enough to reality and adjust later as you become wiser.</p>

<h2 id="strategy-is-focus-and-focus-is-saying-no">Strategy is focus and focus is saying no</h2>

<p>Of all the common mistakes, this one is so common, that I felt it required a seperate section.</p>

<p>Focus is essential to a good strategy. It creates a shared purpose and direction within a team, which is necessary to make meaningful progress. A strategy without focus is like a broken compass — it won’t guide you anywhere.</p>

<p>Most people think that focus is about the things you say ‘yes’ to, but in reality it’s all about the things you say ‘no’ to. A strategy that doesn’t enable people to know what to say ‘no’ to, is not a good strategy.</p>

<h2 id="weigh-in-for-buy-in">Weigh-in for buy-in</h2>

<p>A perfectly defined strategy is worth nothing if the people responsible for carrying it out don’t buy into it. Therefore, the implementation of your strategy begins when you start defining it.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that you should build a strategy that everyone agrees with — that would likely backfire and create a strategy which fails to address the real obstacle or lack the focus to be effective. Instead, you ask questions and test your hypotheses with the people closest to the obstacle and potential solution.</p>

We learn on the job, but what do we really learn? How do we know, and how do we measure?</p>

<p>At one point, after nearly three years in a new and challenging job, I had the opportunity to take a break and reflect on what I’d experienced. I felt that I had learned a lot, but it was elusive. When I had to explain something I thought I’d learned and knew well, it was like holding sand between my fingers. The more I talked, the more it became clear to me that I didn’t fully understand the topic. I now suspect that it was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect" target="_blank">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> in play.</p>

<p>That’s when I decided to try and capture my learnings and do so moving forward as I learn new things. Writing helps me clarify my thoughts and uncover gaps in my knowledge, thereby actively helping me escape the Dunning-Kruger effect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We do not learn from experience. We learn from reflecting on our experience.
<cite>John Dewey</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve chosen to capture my learnings in the format of ‘notes’ because what I write is not, and will not, be the objective truth. It is simply my observation of the world and what I reason from it.</p>

<p>Writing these notes helps me clarify my thinking; maybe they can help others too.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daniel Friis</name><email>d@friis.me</email></author><category term="learning" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Writing notes.
