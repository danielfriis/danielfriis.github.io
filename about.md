Hi, I'm Daniel.

I've spent most of my professional life in the intersection of technology, business, and design. My formal education is in finance and accounting, but I've since found myself doing web development, design, entrepreneurship, management, and everything inbetween.

Since 2015, I've been with [SPACE10](https://www.space10.com) â€” a Research & Design lab, working exclusively with concept innovation on behalf of IKEA.
